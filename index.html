	<h1 style="line-height:150%">Alcohol Consumption Demographics and Outcomes in Portugese Youth</h1>
	<p> Produced for the final project for Data Visualization (DATA 303) at William & Mary.</p>
	<p> By Sarah Larimer & Renee Ritchey</p>
	</header>

	<p>For this project, we want to assess risk behavior In teens. In order to do this, we used a <a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-mat.csv">dataset</a> looking at alcohol consumption in Portuguese teenagers. We wanted to break down our project into two main research questions: Who is more likely to engage in elevated drinking habits? And what are the consequences of this high risk behavior?</p>
	
	<p>We assessed these questions through multiple angles. In order to evaluate who is most likely to drink, we decided to look at how weekend alcohol consumption is related to how often teens go out with friends on the weekend. We also wanted to look at how alcohol consumption is related to traits about the home such as parents marital status and whether or not the student lives in a rural or urban area. </p>
	
	<p>We then assessed the consequences of elevated drinking habits by looking at weekend alcohol consumption and different lifestyle outcomes such as health rating and grades.</p>

	<a id="ParCat">    
    	<h2>Going Out</h2>
	<p>  The first question we wanted to ask was to confirm our hypothesis that the more days a week a
teenager goes out, the more likely they are to drink. As you can see from this graph below, this
is exactly what we see in the data.</p>
    	<iframe src="stackedalc.png" title="GoingOut" width = "100%" height = "110%"
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe>
        </a>
	    
	<a id="Bubble">         
     	<h2>Family Traits</h2>
	<p> The next aspect we wanted to look at for who is more likely to drink is how family dynamics are
related to weekend drinking habits. We looked at the distribution of weekend alcohol
consumption in relation to whether or not parents are still together and whether or not the
student lives in an urban or rural environment. As you can see from the visualization below…..</p>
    	<iframe src="urban_parent_hist-2.png" title="Parent Traits" width = "100%" height = "140%"
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
        </a>
	    
	<a id="Choro">
    	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>Now that we know who is more likely to drink, the second question we wanted to evaluate is
what are the consequences of elevated drinking behaviors. The first question we answered was
what are the health effects of high risk behavior. We attempted to demonstrate this through the
visualization below. </p>
    	<iframe src="parcat_alc-3.html" title="Health" width = "100%" height = "100%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
	</a>
	    
	<a id="Choro">
    	<h2>Grades</h2>
	<p>Lastly, the other consequential thing we wanted to see through visualization was the impact of
high risk behavior on school. Through this, we can see not only how alcohol consumption
impacts health outcomes but also educational outcomes. Through the plot below, you can see
that students who drink more are more likely to drink more.</p>
