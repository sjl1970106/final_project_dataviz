	<h1 style="line-height:150%">Alcohol Consumption Demographics and Outcomes in Portugese Youth</h1>
	<p> Produced for the final project for Data Visualization (DATA 303) at William & Mary.</p>
	<p> By Sarah Larimer & Renee Ritchey</p>
	</header>

	<p>For this project, we wanted to assess risk behavior in teens. We used a <a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-mat.csv">dataset</a> looking at
alcohol consumption in Portuguese teenagers. We wanted to break down our project into two
sections: Who is more likely to engage in elevated drinking habits? And what are the
consequences of this high risk behavior?

	<a id="ParCat">    
    	<h2>Going Out</h2>
	<p>  The first question we wanted to ask was to confirm our hypothesis that the more days a week a
teenager goes out, the more likely they are to drink. As you can see from this graph below, this
is exactly what we see in the data.</p>
    	<iframe src="stackedalc.png" title="GoingOut" width = "100%" height = "110%"
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe>
        </a>
	    
	<a id="Bubble">         
     	<h2>Family Traits</h2>
	<p> The next aspect we wanted to look at for who is more likely to drink is how family dynamics are
related to weekend drinking habits. We looked at the distribution of weekend alcohol
consumption in relation to whether or not parents are still together and whether or not the
student lives in an urban or rural environment. As you can see from the visualization below…..</p>
    	<iframe src="urban_parent_hist-2.png" title="Parent Traits" width = "100%" height = "140%"
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
        </a>
	    
	<a id="Choro">
    	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>Now that we know who is more likely to drink, the second question we wanted to evaluate is
what are the consequences of elevated drinking behaviors. The first question we answered was
what are the health effects of high risk behavior. We attempted to demonstrate this through the
visualization below. </p>
    	<iframe src="parcat_alc-3.html" title="Health" width = "100%" height = "100%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
	</a>
	    
	<a id="Choro">
    	<h2>Grades</h2>
	<p>Lastly, the other consequential thing we wanted to see through visualization was the impact of
high risk behavior on school. Through this, we can see not only how alcohol consumption
impacts health outcomes but also educational outcomes. Through the plot below, you can see
that students who drink more are more likely to drink more.</p>
