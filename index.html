	<h1 style="line-height:150%">Alcohol Consumption Demographics and Outcomes in Portugese Youth</h1>
	<p> Produced for the final project for Data Visualization (DATA 303) at William & Mary.</p>
	<p> By Sarah Larimer & Renee Ritchey</p>
	</header>

	<p>For this project, we want to assess risk behavior In teens. In order to do this, we used a <a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption?select=student-mat.csv">dataset</a> looking at alcohol consumption in Portuguese teenagers. We wanted to break down our project into two main research questions: Who is more likely to engage in elevated drinking habits? And what are the consequences of this high risk behavior?</p>
	
	<p>We assessed these questions through multiple angles. In order to evaluate who is most likely to drink, we decided to look at how weekend alcohol consumption is related to how often teens go out with friends on the weekend. We also wanted to look at how alcohol consumption is related to traits about the home such as parents marital status and whether or not the student lives in a rural or urban area. </p>
	
	<p>We then assessed the consequences of elevated drinking habits by looking at weekend alcohol consumption and different lifestyle outcomes such as health rating and grades.</p>

	<a id="ParCat">    
    	<h2>Going Out</h2>
	<p>The survey asked teens to report how much they drink and how much they go out on the same 1-5 scale with 1 being “None” and 5 being “A lot”. The first question we wanted to ask was to confirm our hypothesis that the more days a week a teenager goes out, the more likely they are to drink. As you can see from this graph below, this is exactly what we see in the data. The share of those who report they drink “a lot” on the weekends increases across how many days a week one goes out— with nobody why does not go out on the weekend reporting high drinking levels whereas 30% of those who go out the most report high drinking levels. Those who go out the most are also least likely to report not drinking. </p>
    	<iframe src="stackedalc.png" title="GoingOut" width = "100%" height = "110%"
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe>
	<p>There are 2 important things to note about this image. First, I would argue that the increase in drinking across days going out is an indicator of lower risk drinking habits. It would be very concerning to see patterns of those who never go out with friends engaging in high levels of drinking. The trends in this chart reveal that weekend alcohol consumption appears to be a more social activity which I would argue is healthier than being a solitary one. </p>
	<p>Secondly, there is a hidden factor that is not accounted for in this chart: age. The students in the data range from 15-22 years old. What this does not tell us is how going out behavior and weekend alcohol consumption relate to age which might play an important part in the trends that we see here. For example, those who are 22 are legal drinkers in Portugal for 4 years and higher levels of going out and weekend alcohol consumption could not necessarily create the same risk as a 15 year old who is going out with friends and consuming alcohol in moderate amounts. </p>

     	<h2>Family Traits</h2>
	<p> The next aspect we wanted to look at for who is more likely to drink is how family dynamics are related to weekend drinking habits. We looked at the distribution of weekend alcohol consumption in relation to whether or not parents are still together and whether or not the student lives in an urban or rural environment. As you can see from the visualization below the results are mixed. Students who live in urban areas with separated parents have the highest share that report very high alcohol consumption. However, the opposite group of students (rural students with parents who are together) report a very similar share who engage in very high weekend alcohol consumption.</p>
    	<iframe src="urban_parent_hist-2.png" title="Parent Traits" width = "100%" height = "140%"
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
	<p>Interestingly enough, student with parents who live together demonstrate a strict decreasing frequency trend where the largest share report very low alcohol consumption and the smallest share report very high alcohol consumption. However, those whose parents are separated do not report this same strict decreasing trend. Lastly, it is interesting to note that urban students whose parents are separated are least likely to report moderate alcohol consumption. Future analysis of this data could benefit from exploring why students report either very low or very high alcohol consumption. </p>

    	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>Now that we know who is more likely to drink, the second question we wanted to evaluate is
what are the consequences of elevated drinking behaviors. The first question we answered was
what are the health effects of high risk behavior. We attempted to demonstrate this through the
visualization below. </p>
    	<iframe src="parcat_alc-3.html" title="Health" width = "100%" height = "100%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
	</a>
	    
	<a id="Choro">
    	<h2>Grades</h2>
	<p>Lastly, the other consequential thing we wanted to see through visualization was the impact of
high risk behavior on school. Through this, we can see not only how alcohol consumption
impacts health outcomes but also educational outcomes. Through the plot below, you can see
that students who drink more are more likely to drink more.</p>
    	<iframe src="grade_density.png" title="Grades" width = "100%" height = "100%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
	<p>There are some very interesting trends that reveal themselves through this visualization. First, while it is not surprising that each category of alcohol consumption follows the same frequency distribution shape, is it interesting to see how the variance changes across drinking levels. For example, those who report the most drinking (5) are relatively equally distributed across the scale of final grades. While around 5% of those who receive a final grade of 0 are the highest drinkers, around 5% of those who receive the highest grade are also the highest drinkers. This relative magnitude changes as weekend drinking decreases. For example, 50% of those who report the lowest grade have the lowest alcohol consumption whereas nearly 75% of those who report the highest grade report the lowest alcohol consumption. </p>
		
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p> In conclusion, our initial hypothesis that those who are more likely to go out are also those who are most likely to engage in the highest levels of drinking. However, family type and urban/rural homes had a mixed effect on those who were most likely to drink. In terms of the outcomes of elevated drinking behaviors, those are also mixed. There is no clear relationship between health outcomes and alcohol use. And while there is a trend of those who drink the least being most likely to recieve the highest grade, those who drink the most have a relatively equal grade distribition.</p>
